result = with_structured_model.invoke("""I recently purchased the EcoBrew Smart Coffee Maker, and it has completely changed my mornings. The setup was straightforward, and the app integration works flawlessly. I love being able to schedule my brew time or start it remotely from my phone. The coffee tastes fantastic, and the machine is surprisingly quiet. Itâ€™s also eco-friendly with reusable filters, which is a big plus. The only downside is that the water reservoir is a bit small for heavy coffee drinkers. Overall, this is a smart, stylish, and efficient addition to my kitchen. Highly recommended for tech-savvy coffee lovers.""")
